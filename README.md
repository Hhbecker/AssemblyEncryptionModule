# LC3AssemblyProgramming

The LC-3 (Little Computer 3) is a software tool that simulates a 16 bit instruction set architecture

the underlying structure of a computer, as manifested in the LC-3;


The LC-3 includes: 
+physical I/O via keyboard and monitor
+TRAPs to the operating system for handling service calls
+conditional branches on (N, Z, and P) condition codes
+a subroutine call/return mechanism
+a minimal set of operate instructions (ADD, AND, and NOT
+various addressing modes for loads and stores (direct, indirect, Base+offset).

I used the LC-3 tools simulator in conjunction with the Introduction to Computing Systems: from bits & gates to C/C++ & beyond by yale n. patt and sanjay j. patel textbook as part of the Computer Architecture course at George Washington University.
