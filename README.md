# LC3AssemblyProgramming

The LC-3 (Little Computer 3) is a software tool that simulates a 16 bit instruction set architecture. 

Chekc out the tool here: [lc3tools](https://github.com/chiragsakhuja/lc3tools)


The LC-3 includes: 
*physical I/O via keyboard and monitor
*TRAPs to the operating system for handling service calls
*conditional branches on (N, Z, and P) condition codes
*a subroutine call/return mechanism
*a minimal set of operate instructions (ADD, AND, and NOT
*various addressing modes for loads and stores (direct, indirect, Base+offset).

I used the LC-3 tools simulator in conjunction with the textbook: Introduction to Computing Systems: from bits & gates to C/C++ & beyond by yale n. patt and sanjay j. patel textbook as part of the Computer Architecture course CS2461 at George Washington University.
